=========

A simple Python script for launching Minecraft. You could use it as a template to make custom Minecraft launchers for modpacks and stuff. You might find it useful, idk. Do what you want. It's on the BSD license FYI. So yeah. Not much to be explained.

FAQ 
===

Oh no, where are all the Minecraft files ?!
-------------------------------------------

They are in the `mcdata` folder that this scripts creates instead of the normal `.minecraft` folder.

Can I install Forge and play cool mods?
---------------------------------------

Well, yeah, obviously. Except when you're installing Forge, you must direct it to the `mcdata` folder instead of the default `.minecraft` folder unless you made a shortcut/symlink there or something.
